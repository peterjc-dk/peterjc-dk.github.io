Time for a reboot of my personal blog. It was frozen for a long time, and created with a now depricated tool. 

Some research led me to a tool called [Jekyll][jekyll-docs], it seams flexeble and simple, and very easy to deploy via [GitHub][github]. The code for this blog can be found at [github.com/peterjc-dk/peterjc-dk.github.io][github-peterjc-dk], and all that is needed to update this site, is first make the changes, then a `git push`
