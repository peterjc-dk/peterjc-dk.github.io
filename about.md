Iâ€™m Peter JC born 1971 in Aarhus, Denmark, where I also grew up. I started at Aarhus University studying Physics and Mathematics, and later I switched to Computer Science in which I took a M.A. 

Computer Science is also a hobby, hence I read books about computer languages and technologies like [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).  and reasondly [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) , and create web-sites and other similar activities. I also have a great interest in photography, music and am active in the scout movement. 


Besides this blog I also blog about software development issues in danish at [QED.dk/peter-juhl-christiansen/](http://qed.dk/peter-juhl-christiansen/). 

[QED.dk](http://qed.dk). is a blogging communety, with software as ovall theme.
